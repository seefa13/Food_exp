                Your decisions and information provided will be recorded <b>anonymously</b> (your response in this experiment cannot be traced back to you.).
            </li>
            <li>Your data will <u>only</u> be used for <b>academic research</b>. </li>
            <li>You can choose at any point during the experiment to stop your participation and your data will be discarded.</li>
            <li>
                If you choose to participate, you will have to make <u> multiple decisions between food items </u> that can lead to <b> different kinds of payments</b>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                {{ C.PaidParts }} participants will be chosen for an actual payout. This means <b>there is a chance for you to actually receive one of your choices</b>. 
                The payout will be realised by you buying the food item and then being reimbursed for it after sending us the receipt of the item.
            </li>
            <li>The study will last about <b>{{ C.AvgDur }} minutes</b>.</li>
