    <ul>
        <li>You are participating in a study conducted by: <img class="UvA-logo" src="{% static UvA_logo %}" /> </li>
        <li>
            Your decisions and information provided will be recorded <b>anonymously</b> (Your response in this experiment cannot be traced back to you.).
        </li>
        <li>Your data will <u>only</u> be used for <b>academic research</b>. </li>
        <li>You can choose at any point during the experiment to stop your participation and your data will be discarded.</li>
        <li>
            If you choose to participate, you will have to make <u> multiple decisions between food items </u> that can lead to <b> different kinds of payments </b>. 
        </li>
        <li>
            {{ C.PaidParts }} participants will be chosen for an actual payout. This means there is a chance for you to actually receive one of your choices.
            Those participants will receive {{ C.Endowment }} - the price of the food product chosen + the food item. 
            The payout will be managed by you buying the food item and then being reimbursed for it.
        </li>
        <li>The study will last about <b>{{ C.AvgDur }} minutes</b>.</li>
